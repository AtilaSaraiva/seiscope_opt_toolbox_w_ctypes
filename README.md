The SEISCOPE optimization toolbox using Ctypes
----------------------------------------------

This repo demonstrates how it is possible to use the [SEISCOPE optimization toolbox](https://seiscope2.osug.fr/SEISCOPE-OPTIMIZATION-TOOLBOX?lang=fr) (written in Fortran) from Python. The original code is public domain and was written by Ludovic MÃ©tivier
and Romain Brossier. Minor changes to the original code have been made to allow the call of the gradient-based optimization subroutines from Python. Such changes and some improvements are listed as follows. 
 * The original source organized in 6 subdirectories, each of which is associated with one gradient-based algorithm was placed in only one folder in a modular fashion. That is, one module for each optimization algorithm grouping the procedures from each one of the old subdirectories.
 *  The Euclidean vector norm and scalar product calculations were replaced with calls to the intrinsic Fortran ```norm2``` and ```dot_product``` functions, respectively.
 *  Removing Trivial Code Duplication: same procedures in Steepest Descent and Preconditioned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient subdirectories.
 *  Removing unused variable declarations.
 *  Vectors of lower and upper bounds (box constraints) are now optional arguments in the optimization subroutines instead of array components of a derived data type

The SEISCOPE toolbox uses a derived data type (`optim`); functionality that is not yet supported at this time by f2py - and for this reason it is used [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).

The repo contains a `src` directory with the modified fortran source files and a subdirectory (`tests`). The python wrapper for the SEISCOPE optimization toolbox is found inside the `seiscope_opt_tb_wrapper` directory. Example run scripts are included in the [`examples`](https://github.com/ofmla/seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes/tree/main/seiscope_opt_tb_wrapper/examples) subdirectory within it. To build the dynamic library from the source files, use the [FoBiS](https://github.com/szaghi/FoBiS) configuration file `seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes.fobis`. 
To do this, type the following 
```
FoBiS.py build -f seiscope_opt_toolbox_w_ctypes.fobis -mode shared-gnu
```
It is also possible to build the library in static form and the `tests` programs by selecting the right `mode` flag. The full set of modes are: `static-gnu`, `static-gnu-debug`, `static-intel`, `static-intel-debug`, `shared-gnu`, `shared-gnu-debug`, `shared-intel`, `shared-intel-debug`, `tests-gnu`, `tests-gnu-debug`, `tests-intel`, `tests-intel-debug`. The modes should be self-explanatory: shared, static and tests are the modes for building (in realese, optimized form) the shared and static versions of the library and the test programs, respectively. The other 3 modes are the same, but in debug form instead of release one. -gnu use the GNU gfortran compiler while -intel the Intel one.

The examples can be run after the shared object has been built to test that wrapper works as it should. Note that you must have [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) installed to run the examples. A python script `plot_curves.py` is also provide in the `python` directory. Please note that it may not be the best implementation and is intended for illustrative purposes only. The following figures were obtained with the `plot_curves.py` script after ran one of the examples.
