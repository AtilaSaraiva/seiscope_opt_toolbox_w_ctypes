The SEISCOPE optimization toolbox using Ctypes
----------------------------------------------

This repo demonstrates how it is possible to use the [SEISCOPE optimization toolbox](https://seiscope2.osug.fr/SEISCOPE-OPTIMIZATION-TOOLBOX?lang=fr) (written in Fortran) from Python. The original code is public domain and was written by Ludovic MÃ©tivier
and Romain Brossier. Minor changes to the original code have been made to allow the call of the gradient-based optimization subroutines from Python. Such changes are and some improvements are listed as follows. 
 * The original source organized in 6 subdirectories, each of which is associated with one gradient-based algorithm was placed in only one folder in a modular fashion. That is, one module for each optimization algorithm grouping the procedures from each one of the old subdirectories.
 *  The Euclidean vector norm and scalar product calculations were replaced with calls to the intrinsic Fortran ```norm2``` and ```dot_product``` functions, respectively.
 *  New Makefile for building a dynamic version of the library with a debug option.
 *  Removing Trivial Code Duplication: same procedures in Steepest Descent and Preconditioned Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient subdirectories.
 *  Removing unused variable declarations.

The SEISCOPE toolbox uses a derived data type (`optim`); functionality that is not yet supported at this time by f2py - and for this reason it is used [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).

The repo contains a single `src` directory with two subdirectories `fortran` and `python`. The modified source files along the `Makefile` are in the `fortran ` folder, while `python` contains two python scripts with examples where the toolbox is used: The *Rosenbrock function* and *Least Square Reverse Time Migration (LSQRTM)* optimization problems. To build the dynamic library from the source files, execute the `Makefile` in the `fortran` directory. The examples can be run after the shared
object has been built to test that it works as it should. Note that you must have [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) installed to run the *LSQRTM* example.

A python script `plot_curves.py` is also provide in the `python` directory. Please note that it may not be the best implementation and is intended for illustrative purposes only. The following figures were obtained after the LSQRTM run with the `plot_curves.py` script.
